Ideas related to Energy and the Environment

### Rough Ideas
Packaging
* (Local) Government **standardised Packaging**
* e.g. all milk in a particular container that's industrially recycled
* e.g. all vegetables in specified packaging that's thought out for recycling
* e.g. electronics designed for repair *and end of life*

Depopulation
* Less people reduces demand for resources
* but not too fast (lack of young people could make life hard see Japan examples perhaps)

Energy Density
* Interesting way to compare Wind/Solar vs. Nuclear Fission/Fusion
* Thermodynamically the denser source sounds sensible and more efficient
* Economically the distributed source has less uncertainty around installation costs
